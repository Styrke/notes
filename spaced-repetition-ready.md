# Subjects that are ready for spaced repetion

When I first learned about [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) I thought that I was going to become some kind of superperson.
Unfortunately that didn't happen, and I don't currently have a spaced repetition routine.
I believe that one of the reasons for my initial failure is that not all kinds of knowledge is suited for rote learning techniques like spaced repetition.

The following is a list of subjects that I think are well suited for rote learning techniques such as spaced repetition.

 - Vocabulary
 - Shortcut keys and commands for software you use often (OS, browser, spaced repetition software, etc.)
 - People (specifically their birthdays, names/faces, interests, etc.)
 - Useful constants and conversions between units and time zones
 - Personal useful stuff
   - Health info (blood type)
   - Credit card info
   - Passport number and expiration date
   - License plates
   - Essential phone numbers
 - The ordering of letters in the alphabet if you never bothered to learn it before (like me)
 - Punctuation: Period and comma
 - The [mnemonic major system](http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Major_System)
 - Quotes or short sentences that you would like to have available as [cached thoughts](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/)
   - [CTAPs and implementation intentions](http://guzey.com/blog/thought-patterns-marginal)<sup>1</sup>
   - Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
 - Musical notation
 - [Myers-Briggs types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)

Many of the items on the list above are inspired by suggestions from the sources below.
They provide a bunch of additional ideas for things to learn there that I decided not to include in my own list either because I don't think they are suitable for rote learning or generally useful to remember.

 - The section about [what to add](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#what-to-add) on the excellent [spaced repetition page](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition) by Gwern.
 - LessWrong post: [Knowledge ready for Ankification](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9qs/knowledge_ready_for_ankification/)
 - Slides from Nick Winter's [slides for a Quantified self talk](http://www.slideshare.net/nickwinter/cognition-learning-and-selftracking-quantified-self-2011). (Specifically slides 7 and 8)
 - LessWrong post: [Memory, Spaced Repetition and Life](http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/) has some good points about what is and isn't worth learning. Mentions NVC as a good example.

See also my collection of [bookmarks about spaced repetition](https://pinboard.in/search/u:Styrke?query=spaced-repetition).

If you know of more repositories with ideas for things to learn with spaced repetition I would like to know about them.

## Footnotes
<sup>1</sup> SquirrelInHell has also shared the contents of a system for CTAPs [here](https://squirrelinhell.github.io/index.html).
It is a good example of how to formulate CTAPs/implementation intentions as questions (triggers) and answers (actions), and it may serve as inspiration for building a similar system.
I am sure that I saw a comment somwhere by SquirrelInHell with more details about the system, but I can't find it now.
